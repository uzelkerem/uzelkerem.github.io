Work experience
======
* October 2018 - October 2022: Doctoral Researcher
  * University of Vienna, Zimmer Lab
  * Using an iconic model organism, _C. elegans_, I performed extensive experiments and analyses on multiple datasets using different approaches: i)graph theoretical analysis of the connectome (revealing clusters, motifs, rich-club structure), ii) randomization and in silico perturbations of network maps, iii) functional analysis of neuronal time-series data (correlation, mutual information, granger causality), and iv) genetic inhibition of selected neurons (cloning constructs, generating transgenic strains, performing whole-brain calcium imaging experiments in worms). 
    
    During this study, I frequently presented my work to a broad audience, trained PhDs and postdocs in experimental and computational techniques, and published my work in a high quality academic journal (Uzel et al., 2022, Current Biology). This work is the first comprehensive structure-to-function analysis which makes a significant contribution to the ongoing research in the field of systems neuroscience and connectomics.

* May 2015 - October 2018: Doctoral Researcher
  * Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) Austria, Zimmer Lab
  * Zimmer lab was located in IMP between 2015-2018.

* September 2011 - June 2014: Master's Student
  * Boğaziçi University, FISH lab
  * Using zebrafish as a model organism, I validated the use of an intergenic sequence as a molecular tool to promote bi-cistronic translation in the olfactory neurons. This research taught me how to follow a scientific question from beginning to an end. Accordingly I gained skillsets in use of molecular biology tools and confocal microscopy techniques using the neurons as models. This work inspired me to develop an interest to pursue a PhD in neuroscience.
