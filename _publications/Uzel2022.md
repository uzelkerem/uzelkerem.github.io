excerpt: 'In this paper, we report that in _C. elegans_
functional interactions between neurons
are best understood by connectome
context, like triplet motifs and input
similarities, rather than by direct
connectivity. We show that the hub
architecture is crucial for establishing this
context. Consistently, inhibiting sets of
hub neurons disrupts brain dynamics.<br/>
