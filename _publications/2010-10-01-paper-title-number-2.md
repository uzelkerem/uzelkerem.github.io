title: "A set of hub neurons and non-local connectivity
features support global brain dynamics in C. elegans"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Uzel2022
excerpt: 'In this paper, we report that in C. elegans
functional interactions between neurons
are best understood by connectome
context, like triplet motifs and input
similarities, rather than by direct
connectivity. We show that the hub
architecture is crucial for establishing this
context. Consistently, inhibiting sets of
hub neurons disrupts brain dynamics.'
